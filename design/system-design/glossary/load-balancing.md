# Load Balancing (LB)

## It Helps to
- scale horizontally across an ever-increasing number of servers.
- spread the traffic across a cluster of servers

## LB locations

- Between user and web server
- Between web servers and an internal platform layer (application servers, cache servers)
- Between internal platform layer and database

## Algorithms

- Least connection
- Least response time
- Least bandwidth
- Round robin
- Weighted round robin
- IP hash

## Implementation

- Smart clients
- Hardware load balancers
- Software load balancers
